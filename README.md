#DEEP LEARNING BASED DIAGNOSIS OF PARKINSON’S DISEASE

Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that exhibits a range of motor and non-motor symptoms, complicating its diagnosis. Traditional diagnostic techniques rely heavily on clinical evaluations, which can be subjective and vary between observers. To address these challenges, we introduce a comprehensive, automated diagnostic system for Parkinson's Disease using a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates diverse data types: Gait patterns, Audio recordings, and Handwriting samples. Each data modality is specifically chosen to capture different facets of PD. Gait analysis reflects motor capabilities, Audio recordings assess vocal attributes, and Handwriting analysis evaluates fine motor skills. Utilizing pretrained deep learning architectures such as VGG for gait video analysis, and tailored convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for audio and handwriting data, our approach involves fine-tuning these models on respective datasets. The methodology includes individual training of each modality-specific model to extract relevant features, which are subsequently integrated using an advanced fusion technique designed to consolidate and leverage multimodal data for enhanced diagnostic accuracy. This integration aims to construct a holistic view of the patient’s condition, facilitating a more objective and consistent diagnosis compared to traditional methods.

Our project endeavours to develop a scalable, multimodal diagnostic tool with potential applications beyond Parkinson's Disease, assisting clinicians in early detection and enabling tailored treatment strategies. This approach underscores the transformative potential of deep learning in medical diagnostics, paving the way for future advancements in healthcare technology.
