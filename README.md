# parkinsons-disease-diagnosis-dl
The project aims to diagnose Parkinson’s disease using deep learning techniques applied to datasets such as Speech recordings, Handwriting samples, MRI images, and Gait analysis. The goal is to develop models that detect key patterns in each dataset, leading to a more comprehensive and reliable diagnostic method.
